# Goal

My goal with this project was to practice **_Typescript_**, **_React Hooks_** and **_Styled Components_** in order to understand their usage in React projects.

## Wins

- React Hooks - it was my first project using hooks and I couldn't be more enthusiasted. The code feels cleanier comparing to managing state through class components. It was a great experience and I think I will invest on using them from now on.

- Styled Components - My first impression is that their potential is very high and it simplifies styling in many more ways than I thought. I had a hard time using it for table elements though.

## Challenges:

- Typescript revealed itself quite useful in some cases, but in other cases I felt that it was overkill, as for example passing a state hook to a child component.
  It's something that I have to keep working on and I will definitely review most of the concepts and interface usage.

- Transforming the table from horizontal to vertical view solely with CSS was actually quite a big challenge. I didn't know where to start but with Google's help I found a starting point and I builded up from there.

- I also had some troubles with the Header Cell components regarding it's lifecycle. Nevertheless, getting away from the computer and think it through gave me a different perspective and I realized I was missing one condition to style it properly on render.

- Last but not least, the project's architecture was a constant challenge. I think that it's something that will come with experience and working in a team should bring me the click that I need to understand better arquitectures, dos and don'ts.

## Points to improve:

- Scalability! I hard-coded a few things that could be escalated and perhaps it would be wiser to make them more scalable - arrays are useful for that.

- CSS - I definitely need more practice. I felt comfortable with most of things, but when it comes to pseudo-elements I am a rookie.
  Responsiveness is also something I have to practice - I have difficulties with understanding what are the optimal breakpoints in order to make things look nice on every device available on Google Chrome Dev Tools.
